Version 4.0: Initial release for GAP 4.

Version 4.1:

  - Name change from CrystGAP (or CrystGap) to just Cryst. This avoids
    confusion, as even CrystGAP was always loaded as "cryst".

  - A second algorithm for the computation of Wyckoff positions 
    (due to Ad Thiers) has been implemented. It avoids the computation
    of a subgroup lattice, and is faster in small dimensions.
    It is used by default for dimensions <= 4. The two available
    algorithms can be called directly using the functions

    WyPosAT( S );    # algorithm due to Ad Thiers
    WyPosSGL( S );   # algorithm using the subgroup lattice

    These functions are still undocumented.

  - A bug in WyckoffGraph was fixed. The labels of the lines in the 
    graph were not what was intended, and the manual was even 
    selfcontradictory in this respect. 

    This required code for intersections of affine subspace lattices, 
    and a better subset test for affine subspace lattices. 
    These are still undocumented.

  - The function ConjugatorSpaceGroups is now documented.

  - Cryst now tries to load the package polycyclic, and then installs
    methods for IsomorphismPcpGroup for PointGroups and AffineCrystGroups.

  - A method for ImagesRepresentative for an IsomorphismFpGroup of an 
    AffineCrystGroup has been added, so that the resulting isomorphism
    can now really be used.

  - Switch to the new attribute MappingGeneratorsImages. Compatibility 
    with GAP 4.2 and GAP 4.1 is maintained.

  - A bug in Normalizer for two AffineCrystGroupsOnLeft was fixed;
    it returned an AffineCrystGroupOnRight.

  - The number of generators returned by Normalizer for two 
    AffineCrystGroups was reduced.

  - A bug in ConjugacyClassesMaximalSubgroups for space groups was fixed; 
    their size was set to a wrong value in certain cases. 

  - A mutability bug in AffineNormalizer was fixed.

Version 4.1.1:

  - Online help should now work for all functions.

  - Fixed several manual examples changed output or wrong input.

  - Avoided some multiplications of an empty list with a matrix.

  - Support for new package loading mechanism in GAP 4.4

  - Mutability problem fixed

Version 4.1.4

  - Two instances of multiplying an empty list with a matrix fixed

Version 4.1.5

  - Incomplete translation basis fixed

Version 4.1.6

  - TranslationBasis for trivial point group fixed
  - Bug in ImagesRepresentative for IsomorphismFpGroup of an
    AffineCrystGroupOnLeft fixed
