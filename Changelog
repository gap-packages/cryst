Version 4.1:

  - A second algorithm for the computation of Wyckoff positions 
    (due to Ad Thiers) has been implemented. It avoids the computation
    of a subgroup lattice, and is faster in small dimensions.
    It is used by default for dimensions <= 4. The two available
    algorithms can be called directly using the functions

    WyPosAT( S );    # algorithm due to Ad Thiers
    WyPosSGL( S );   # algorithm using the subgroup lattice

  - A bug in WyckoffGraph was fixed. The labels of the lines in the 
    graph were not what was intended, and the manual was even 
    selfcontradictory in this respect. 

    This needed code for intersections of affine subspace lattices, 
    and a better subset test for affine subspace lattices. 
    These are still undocumented.

  - The function ConjugatorSpaceGroups is now documented.

  - CrystGap now tries to load the package polycyclic, and then installs
    methods for IsomorphismPcpGroup for PointGroups and AffineCrystGroups.
    As polycyclic is not publicly available, these methods are not yet 
    documented.

  - A method for ImagesRepresentative for an IsomorphismFpGroup of an 
    AffineCrystGroup has been added, so that the resulting isomorphism
    can now really be used.

  - Switch to the new attribute MappingGeneratorsImages. Compatibility 
    with GAP 4.2 and GAP 4.1 is maintained.

  - A bug in Normalizer for two AffineCrystGroupsOnLeft was fixed;
    it returned an AffineCrystGroupOnRight.

  - The number of generators returned by Normalizer for two 
    AffineCrystGroups was reduced.

  - A bug in ConjugacyClassesMaximalSubgroups for space groups was fixed; 
    their size was set to a wrong value in certain cases.
