The CrystGap share package provides functions for the computation 
with affine crystallographic groups, in particular space groups.  
It is loaded with the command
\beginexample 
     gap> RequirePackage( "cryst" ); 
\endexample

The present version for {\GAP}~4.1 has been considerably reworked 
from an earlier version for {\GAP}~3.4.4. Besides `AffineCrystGroups'
acting from the right, also `AffineCrystGroups' acting from the 
left are now fully supported. Many algorithms have been added,
extended, or improved in other ways.

CrystGap is implemented in the {\GAP}~4 language, and runs on any 
system supporting {\GAP}~4.1. However, certain commands may require 
that other share packages such as CARAT or XGAP are installed. 
Both CARAT and XGAP are available only under Unix.
