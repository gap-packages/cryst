The GAP 4 share package CrystGap 4.0 is the successor of the GAP 3 
share package with the same name. During the porting process to
GAP 4, large parts of the code have been rewritten, and the 
functionality has been extended considerably. CrystGap provides a 
rich set of methods to compute with affine crystallographic groups, 
in particular space groups. In constrast to the GAP 3 version, 
affine crystallographic groups are now fully supported both in the 
representation acting from the right and in the representation 
acting from the left. The latter representation is the one preferred 
by crystallographers. There are also functions to determine 
representatives of all space group types of a given dimension. 

CrystGap is implemented in the GAP 4 language, and runs on any
system supporting GAP 4. It requires at least GAP version 4.1, 
with fixes up 1,2 and 4 applied. However, certain commands may 
need other share packages such as Carat or XGAP. Both Carat and 
XGAP are available only under Unix. Carat may be required by 
functions that need to know normalizers or conjugators of finite 
unimodular groups in in GL(n,Z) (see Section 9 of the CrystGap 
manual). The function WyckoffGraph needs the package XGAP.

To install CrystGap, just unpack cryst.zoo in the pkg subdirectory
of your GAP installation (or in the pkg subdirectory of any other
GAP root directory) with the following command:

unzoo -x cryst.zoo

CrystGap is then loaded with the GAP command

gap> RequirePackage( "cryst" );
